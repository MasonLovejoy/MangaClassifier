# Manga Classifier

Manga Classifier is python machine learning application using pytorch. The main basis for classifying the manga is a convolutional neural network.
After the model was trained a website was created to deploy the model in order to check to see how pytorch deploys models.

## Usage

The model can be tested on www.mangaclassifier.com and currently has a 87% accuracy for 19 manga. Current sortable manga are: 
Baki, Berserk, Bleach, Eyeshield 21, Fairy Tail, Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma, Gantz, Gintama, Haikyu!, Hajime no Ippo, 
Hunter x Hunter, Inuyasha, Jojo's Bizzare Adventure, Kingdom, Naruto, One Piece, Pok√©mon Adventures, Slamdunk, and Vagabond.

Upload a picture of a panel from one of these manga and the CNN will attempt to predict which manga the panel is from.
